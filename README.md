# probability-of-toss-a-coin

flipping coin and see as probabilities of turn heads 
rand the function use to expect either one 
when rand give equal posibility of final selection as such head if value is less than 0.5 and tails when value is more than 0.5
there is a equalt chance of happing either one expectation.

# experimental probability

how likelly something to happen

number trails : n

heads occur: m

tails occur: n-m

P(head)= m/n

# experiment

toss the coin in n nuber of time and observed the heads occured in number out of trails 

# observed

P(trail) near to 0.5 as it has given same chance to ones occur 

# picking mables on box(3 red, 2 blue, 5 green)

P(red)= n(red)/n(all)=3/10

p(red')=1-p(red)=7/10
